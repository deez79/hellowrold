# Course Materials:
* taq.website/PYTH2
* the gitrepo has all of the needed materials.

# Final Project:
* Each day you'll build skills in pyton and understand different ways in which you can use it to build applications.
* At the end of the 4th week, you'll choose a final proect focus.
* At the end opf the 10th week, you'll demo your project for the class.

# Github:
* manage and maintain our homework assignments and final project.

# Tools:
* Github
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Colab.  Use Colab, and not local Jupyter Notebooks.

# Essential Terminology:
* What is a computer program? 
    * highly logical and explicit instructions that are parsed by the computer.
* Source Code:  code writen by person in some language
* Compliler:    takes source code and transforms it into machine code.
* How Program is written:
    * Javascript:   interpreted.
    * Python:   interpreted.
    * Java:     compiled.
    * Ruby:     interpreted.
    * C/C++:    compiled.
* 3 Fundemental Concepts:
    1. Declarations: a way to store and retrieve data types.
        * Variable: will hold info.
        * Data Type: a subset of a decleration that holds information:
            * Primatives: number, string, boolean, null, list, dict
    2. Expressions: a way to transform a data type.
        * data types transformed via opperators. 
        * Operators: addition, subtraction, equivalence, ...... etc
        * opperators are defined by data type.
    3. Statements and Control Flow:
        * statments allow control flow.
        * loops, if, else ............ etc
